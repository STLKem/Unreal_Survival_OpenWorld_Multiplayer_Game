## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- 🎮 Unreal Engine 5  
- 🔵 Blueprints  
- 🌤️ Ultra Dynamic Sky  
- 🌫️ Ultra Volumetric Fog  
- 🧱 Nanite  
- 🌿 Foliage System  
- 🧩 Level Streaming  
- 🎬 Level Sequence / Trigger Box

## 🧩 Implemented Systems & Features

### 🏗️ Building System
- Created fully in **Blueprints** based on tutorials, with custom modifications.  
- Learned **collision handling, snapping, and component replication**.  
- 📂 *Files:* `/Blueprints/BuildingSystem/`

---

### 🎣 Fishing System
- Mini-game with **interactive WASD keys** (quick-time event).  
- Focused on logic — no advanced graphics yet.  
- 📂 *Files:* `/Blueprints/FishingSystem/`

---

### 🧭 Quest & Dialogue System
- **Quest Manager + Dialogue System** working together.  
- Triggers events and cutscenes after completing quests.  
- 📂 *Files:* `/Blueprints/QuestSystem/`, `/Blueprints/DialogSystem/`

---

### 💡 Lighting & Fog
- Integrated **Ultra Dynamic Sky** and **Ultra Volumetric Fog**.  
- Created atmosphere and limited visibility similar to *Silent Hill*.  
- 📂 *Files:* `/Levels/LightingSetup/`

---

### 🧱 Project Optimization
- Implemented **Level Streaming** for memory management.  
- Reduced dependencies between assets and Blueprints.  
- Tested **Nanite** and optimized **Foliage** performance.  
- 📂 *Files:* `/Levels/SubLevels/`, `/Assets/Foliage/`

---

### 🎬 Environmental Sequences & Animations
- Used **Level Sequence** and **Trigger Boxes** to trigger animations (e.g., moving objects when entering a zone).  
- 📂 *Files:* `/Blueprints/Triggers/`, `/Sequences/`

---

### 🚶‍♂️ Character Movement
- **True First Person Locomotion** system (8 directions + head bob).  
- 📂 *Files:* `/Blueprints/Character/`

---

## 📚 What I Learned
- Practical knowledge of **Blueprints** and **Unreal Engine 5 project structure**  
- Optimization techniques (Level Streaming, Nanite, Asset Management)  
- Working with lighting, fog, and environmental effects  
- Designing basic gameplay systems  
- Integrating visual effects with game logic

## 🧠 Conclusions & Next Steps
This project taught me how to combine multiple UE5 systems into a coherent prototype.  
It was my **first serious step** toward game development.  
Currently, I am working on my next project: **Voxel Survival**,  
which features procedural world generation, multiplayer, and an inventory system.
